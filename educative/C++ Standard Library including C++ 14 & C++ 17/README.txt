Course Overview
    C++ is one of the most prominent programming languages in the world. Along with optimized 
    performance, the diverse functionality it offers has kept the language relevant for two 
    decades. The C++ Standard Library, which is the collection of all the tools and utilities 
    available in C++, received its latest update in 2017. Known as C++17, the update introduces 
    many new features that further optimize our code.

    Join us in this course as we venture into the vast world of C++17. We’ll examine the 
    fundamentals of the language, before moving on to more complex yet powerful tools. You can 
    also experiment with the code provided and hence, gain a higher understanding of how things 
    work. This course is perfect for anyone willing to fully grasp C++ and use it to its full 
    potential. Welcome aboard!

How You'll Learn
    Hands-on coding environments
    You don’t get better at swimming by watching others. Coding is no different. Practice as you 
    learn with live code environments inside your browser.

    Faster than videos
    Videos are holding you back. The average video tutorial is spoken at 150 words per minute, 
    while you can read at 250. That‘s why our courses are text-based.

    No set-up required
    Start learning immediately instead of fiddling with SDKs and IDEs. It‘s all on the cloud.

    Progress you can show
    Built in assessments let you test your skills. Completion certificates let you show them off.
