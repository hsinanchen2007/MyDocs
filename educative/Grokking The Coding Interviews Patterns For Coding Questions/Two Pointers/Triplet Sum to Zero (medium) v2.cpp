Solution#
This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and shares similarities with Pair with Target Sum. 
A couple of differences are that the input array is not sorted and instead of a pair we need to 
find triplets with a target sum of zero.

To follow a similar approach, first, we will sort the array and then iterate through it taking 
one number at a time. Let’s say during our iteration we are at number ‘X’, so we need to find 
‘Y’ and ‘Z’ such that X + Y + Z == 0. At this stage, our problem translates into finding a pair 
whose sum is equal to “-X” (as from the above equation Y + Z == -X).

Another difference from Pair with Target Sum is that we need to find all the unique triplets. 
To handle this, we have to skip any duplicate number. Since we will be sorting the array, so all 
the duplicate numbers will be next to each other and are easier to skip.

Time complexity#
Sorting the array will take O(N * logN). The searchPair() function will take O(N). As we are calling 
searchPair() for every number in the input array, this means that overall searchTriplets() will 
take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2)

Space complexity#
Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will 
be O(N) which is required for sorting.
