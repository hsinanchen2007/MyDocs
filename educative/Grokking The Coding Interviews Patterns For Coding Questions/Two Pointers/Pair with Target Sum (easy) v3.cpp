An Alternate approach#
Instead of using a two-pointer or a binary search approach, we can utilize a HashTable to search for 
the required pair. We can iterate through the array one number at a time. Let’s say during our iteration 
we are at number ‘X’, so we need to find ‘Y’ such that “X + Y == Target”. We will do two things here:

Search for ‘Y’ (which is equivalent to “Target - X”) in the HashTable. If it is there, we have found the 
required pair. Otherwise, insert “X” in the HashTable, so that we can search it for the later numbers.

Time Complexity#
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in 
the given array.

Space Complexity#
The space complexity will also be O(N), as, in the worst case, we will be pushing ‘N’ numbers in the 
HashTable.
