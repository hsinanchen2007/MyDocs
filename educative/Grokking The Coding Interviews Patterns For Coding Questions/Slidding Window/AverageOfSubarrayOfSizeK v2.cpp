Time complexity: Since for every element of the input array, we are calculating 
the sum of its next ‘K’ elements, the time complexity of the above algorithm will 
be O(N*K), where ‘N’ is the number of elements in the input array.

Can we find a better solution? Do you see any inefficiency in the above approach?

The inefficiency is that for any two consecutive subarrays of size ‘5’, the overlapping 
part (which will contain four elements) will be evaluated twice. For example, take 
the above-mentioned input:

As you can see, there are four overlapping elements between the subarray (indexed 
from 0-4) and the subarray (indexed from 1-5). Can we somehow reuse the sum we have 
calculated for the overlapping elements?

The efficient way to solve this problem would be to visualize each subarray as a 
sliding window of ‘5’ elements. This means that we will slide the window by one 
element when we move on to the next subarray. To reuse the sum from the previous 
subarray, we will subtract the element going out of the window and add the element 
now being included in the sliding window. This will save us from going through the 
whole subarray to find the sum and, as a result, the algorithm complexity will reduce 
to O(N)

Here is the algorithm for the Sliding Window approach:

*/

using namespace std;

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK {
 public:
  static vector<double> findAverages(int K, const vector<int>& arr) {
    vector<double> result(arr.size() - K + 1);
    double windowSum = 0;
    int windowStart = 0;
    for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < arr.size(); windowEnd++) {
      windowSum += arr[windowEnd];  // add the next element
      // slide the window, we don't need to slide if we've not hit the required window size of 'k'
      if (windowEnd >= K - 1) {
        result[windowStart] = windowSum / K;  // calculate the average
        windowSum -= arr[windowStart];        // subtract the element going out
        windowStart++;                        // slide the window ahead
      }
    }

    return result;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  vector<double> result =
      AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK::findAverages(5, vector<int>{1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2});
  cout << "Averages of subarrays of size K: ";
  for (double d : result) {
    cout << d << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
