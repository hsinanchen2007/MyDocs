Introduction

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate 
something among all the subarrays (or sublists) of a given size. For example, take a look 
at this problem:

Given an array, find the average of all subarrays of ‘K’ contiguous elements in it.

Let’s understand this problem with a real input:

Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2], K=5
Here, we are asked to find the average of all subarrays of ‘5’ contiguous elements in the 
given array. Let’s solve this:

For the first 5 numbers (subarray from index 0-4), the average is: (1+3+2+6-1)/5 => 2.2
(1+3+2+6−1)/5=>2.2
The average of next 5 numbers (subarray from index 1-5) is: (3+2+6-1+4)/5 => 2.8
(3+2+6−1+4)/5=>2.8
For the next 5 numbers (subarray from index 2-6), the average is: (2+6-1+4+1)/5 => 2.4
(2+6−1+4+1)/5=>2.4

…
Here is the final output containing the averages of all subarrays of size 5:

Output: [2.2, 2.8, 2.4, 3.6, 2.8]
A brute-force algorithm will calculate the sum of every 5-element subarray of the given array 
and divide the sum by ‘5’ to find the average. This is what the algorithm will look like:

*/

using namespace std;

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK {
 public:
  static vector<double> findAverages(int K, const vector<int>& arr) {
    vector<double> result(arr.size() - K + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i <= arr.size() - K; i++) {
      // find sum of next 'K' elements
      double sum = 0;
      for (int j = i; j < i + K; j++) {
        sum += arr[j];
      }
      result[i] = sum / K;  // calculate average
    }

    return result;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  vector<double> result =
      AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK::findAverages(5, vector<int>{1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2});
  cout << "Averages of subarrays of size K: ";
  for (double d : result) {
    cout << d << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
