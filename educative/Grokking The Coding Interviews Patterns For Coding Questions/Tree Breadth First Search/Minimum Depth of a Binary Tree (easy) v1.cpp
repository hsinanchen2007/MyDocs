Find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the 
shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node.

Example 1:

 Minimum Depth:  
 2  
    1   
    2   
    3   
    4   
    5   

Example 2:

 Minimum Depth:  
    12   
    7   
    1   
    9   
    10   
    5   
    11   
 Minimum Depth: 2  
 3  
    12   
    7   
    1   
    10   
    5
