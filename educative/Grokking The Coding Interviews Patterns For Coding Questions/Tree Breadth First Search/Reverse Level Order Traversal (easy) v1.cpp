Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal in reverse order, 
i.e., the lowest level comes first. You should populate the values of all nodes in each level from 
left to right in separate sub-arrays.

Example 1:

    1   
    2   
    3   
    4   
    5   
    6   
    7   
 [[4,5,6,7],[2,3],[1]]  
 Reverse Level Order Traversal:  

Example 2:

    12   
    7   
    1   
    9   
    10   
    5   
 [[9,10,5],[7,1],[12]]  
 Reverse Level Order Traversal:
