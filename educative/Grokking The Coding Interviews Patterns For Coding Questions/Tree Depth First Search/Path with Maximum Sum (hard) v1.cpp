Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a function that returns 
the maximum sum.

A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily 
pass through the root. The path must contain at least one node.

 Example 1:  
    1   
    2   
    3   
    4   
    5   
    6   

 Output: 16
 Explanation: The path with maximum sum is: [4, 2, 1, 3, 6]  
 
 Example 2:  
    1   
    2   
    3   
    1   
    3   
    5   
    6   
    7   
    8   
    9

 Output: 31
 Explanation: The path with maximum sum is: [8, 5, 3, 6, 9]
