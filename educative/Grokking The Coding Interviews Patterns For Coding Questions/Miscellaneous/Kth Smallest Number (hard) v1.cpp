Given an unsorted array of numbers, find Kth smallest number in it.

Please note that it is the Kth smallest number in the sorted order, not the Kth distinct 
element.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 5, 12, 2, 11, 5], K = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The 3rd smallest number is '5', as the first two smaller numbers are [1, 2].

Example 2:

Input: [1, 5, 12, 2, 11, 5], K = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The 4th smallest number is '5', as the first three smaller numbers are
[1, 2, 5].

Example 3:

Input: [5, 12, 11, -1, 12], K = 3
Output: 11
Explanation: The 3rd smallest number is '11', as the first two small numbers are [5, -1].

This is a well-known problem and there are multiple solutions available to solve this. 
A few other similar problems are:

Find the Kth largest number in an unsorted array.
Find the median of an unsorted array.
Find the ‘K’ smallest or largest numbers in an unsorted array.

Let’s discuss different algorithms to solve this problem and understand their time and space 
complexity. Similar solutions can be devised for the above-mentioned three problems.
