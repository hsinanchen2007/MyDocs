3. Using Max-Heap
As discussed in Kth Smallest Number, we can iterate the array and use a Max Heap to 
keep track of ‘K’ smallest number. In the end, the root of the heap will have the Kth 
smallest number.

Here is what this algorithm will look like:

Time & Space Complexity
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(K*logK + (N-K)*logK) which is 
asymptotically equal to O(N*logK). The space complexity will be O(K) because we need to 
store ‘K’ smallest numbers in the heap.

#include <vector>

class KthSmallestNumber {
 public:
  static int findKthSmallestNumber(const vector<int> &nums, int k) {
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap;

    // put first k numbers in the max heap
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      maxHeap.push(nums[i]);
    }

    // go through the remaining numbers of the array, if the number from the array is smaller than
    // the top (biggest) number of the heap, remove the top number from heap and add the number from
    // array
    for (int i = k; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      if (nums[i] < maxHeap.top()) {
        maxHeap.pop();
        maxHeap.push(nums[i]);
      }
    }

    // the root of the heap has the Kth smallest number
    return maxHeap.top();
  }
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int result = KthSmallestNumber::findKthSmallestNumber(vector<int>{1, 5, 12, 2, 11, 5}, 3);
  cout << "Kth smallest number is: " << result << endl;

  // since there are two 5s in the input array, our 3rd and 4th smallest numbers should be a '5'
  result = KthSmallestNumber::findKthSmallestNumber(vector<int>{1, 5, 12, 2, 11, 5}, 4);
  cout << "Kth smallest number is: " << result << endl;

  result = KthSmallestNumber::findKthSmallestNumber(vector<int>{5, 12, 11, -1, 12}, 3);
  cout << "Kth smallest number is: " << result << endl;
