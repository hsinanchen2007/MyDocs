Introduction
A huge number of coding interview problems involve dealing with Permutations and 
Combinations of a given set of elements. This pattern describes an efficient Breadth 
First Search (BFS) approach to handle all these problems.

Letâ€™s jump onto our first problem to develop an understanding of this pattern.

Given a set with distinct elements, find all of its distinct subsets.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 3]
Output: [], [1], [3], [1,3]

Example 2:

Input: [1, 5, 3]
Output: [], [1], [5], [3], [1,5], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3]
