Similar Problems
Problem 1: Can we solve the above problem in O(1) space and without modifying the input array?

Solution: While doing the cyclic sort, we realized that the array will have a cycle due to the duplicate 
number and that the start of the cycle will always point to the duplicate number. This means that we can 
use the fast & the slow pointer method to find the duplicate number or the start of the cycle similar to 
Start of LinkedList Cycle.

The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1)
