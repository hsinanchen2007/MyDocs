GROKKING NOTES
I liked the way Grokking the coding interview organized problems into learnable patterns. 
However, the course is expensive and the majority of the time the problems are copy-pasted from leetcode. 
As the explanations on leetcode are usually just as good, the course really boils down to being a glorified 
curated list of leetcode problems.

So below I made a list of leetcode problems that are as close to grokking problems as possible.

Pattern: Sliding Window
53.   https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/ # Close enough
209.  https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/

Thanks for the list!

I think Pattern: Two Pointers first grok question "Pair with Target Sum" is more like Two Sum II than Two Sum because the input is sorted. In Two Sum, the input is not sorted, so a Two Pointer solution (sort first) is slower than the O(N) caching solution. In Two Sum II, the input is sorted, and we're can't use extra space, so the Two Pointer solution makes sense

Sliding window is only valid if all the values are positive I think.

For 0/1 Knapsack: Minimum Subset Sum Difference: https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference/
Maybe a significant difference is that the array lengths should be len(nums)/2 shrug

@unrelentingfox
unrelentingfox commented 22 days ago • 
The topological sort 1st and 3rd question is exactly the same as a solution in Grokking. I converted the List to return int[] instead however when I test it on leetcode, the output is not in the same order. Does anyone know something?

The direction of the dependency graph in the leetcode problem is in reverse. For each edge, the first value is a course, the second value is it's pre-requisite. To determine the order in which to take all of the courses, you traverse from pre-requisite -> course.

So from your code change this:
int parent = edges[i][0], child = edges[i][1]
to this:
int parent = edges[i][1], child = edges[i][0]
