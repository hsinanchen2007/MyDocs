Introduction

The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm 
that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. 
This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers 
are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic 
loop.

One of the famous problems solved using this technique was Finding a cycle in a LinkedList. Letâ€™s jump 
onto this problem to understand the Fast & Slow pattern.

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a cycle in it or not.

 Example:  
 head  
 Following LinkedList has a cycle:  
 Following LinkedList doesn't have a cycle:  
    2   
    4   
    6   
    8   
    10   
    null   
    1   
    2   
    3   
    4   
    5   
    6   
 head
