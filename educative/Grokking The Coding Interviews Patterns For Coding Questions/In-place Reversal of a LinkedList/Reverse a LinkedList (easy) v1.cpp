Introduction
In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. 
Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects 
and without using extra memory.

In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern describes an efficient way to solve the above problem. 
In the following chapters, we will solve a bunch of problems using this pattern.

Let’s jump on to our first problem to understand this pattern.
