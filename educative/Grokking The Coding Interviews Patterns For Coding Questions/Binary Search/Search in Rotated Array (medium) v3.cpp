Similar Problems#
Problem 1#
How do we search in a sorted and rotated array that also has duplicates?

The code above will fail in the following example!

Example 1:

Input: [3, 7, 3, 3, 3], key = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: '7' is present in the array at index '1'.
 Original array:  
    3   
    3   
    3   
    3   
    7   
 Array after 2 rotations:  
    3   
    7   
    3   
    3   
    3   

Solution #
The only problematic scenario is when the numbers at indices start, middle, and end are the same, as in this 
case, we canâ€™t decide which part of the array is sorted. In such a case, the best we can do is to skip one 
number from both ends: start = start + 1 & end = end - 1.

using namespace std;

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class SearchRotatedWithDuplicate {
 public:
  static int search(const vector<int>& arr, int key) {
    int start = 0, end = arr.size() - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
      int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
      if (arr[mid] == key) {
        return mid;
      }

      // the only difference from the previous solution,
      // if numbers at indexes start, mid, and end are same, we can't choose a side
      // the best we can do, is to skip one number from both ends as key != arr[mid]
      if ((arr[start] == arr[mid]) && (arr[end] == arr[mid])) {
        ++start;
        --end;
      } else if (arr[start] <= arr[mid]) {  // left side is sorted in ascending order
        if (key >= arr[start] && key < arr[mid]) {
          end = mid - 1;
        } else {  // key > arr[mid]
          start = mid + 1;
        }
      } else {  // right side is sorted in ascending order
        if (key > arr[mid] && key <= arr[end]) {
          start = mid + 1;
        } else {
          end = mid - 1;
        }
      }
    }

    // we are not able to find the element in the given array
    return -1;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  cout << SearchRotatedWithDuplicate::search(vector<int>{3, 7, 3, 3, 3}, 7) << endl;
}
