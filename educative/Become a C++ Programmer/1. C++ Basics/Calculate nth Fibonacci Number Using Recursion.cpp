fibonacci function 
The recursive fibonacci function takes a value of type int in its input parameters and returns 
the Fibonacci number at that value in the output.

Recursive case

Each element in fibonacci is a sum of its previous two elements. We recursively sum the last two 
elements until the base case. fibonacci returns the sum of fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2). 
This is the recursive case.

First base case

As the fibonacci 1st element is 1, if n = 0, the function terminates after returning 0 to the 
calling function.

Second base case

As the fibonacci 1st element is 1, if n = 1, the function terminates after returning 1 to the 
calling function.

Letâ€™s run our code for n = 4 and see what happens inside the recursive fibonacci function.

In the Fibonacci function, there are two recursive calls in the function body. Therefore, it is 
known as a binary recursion.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Recursive fibonacci function
int Fibonacci(int n) {

  // Base Case
  if (n == 0) {
    return 0;
  } 
  else if (n == 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Recursive Case
  else {
    return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
  }

}

// main function
int main() {
  // Initialize variable n
  int n = 4;
  // Declare variable result
  int result;
  // Call fibonacci function in main and store its output in result
  result = Fibonacci(4);
  // Print value of result
  cout << n << "th Fibonacci number = " << result;
  return 0;
}
