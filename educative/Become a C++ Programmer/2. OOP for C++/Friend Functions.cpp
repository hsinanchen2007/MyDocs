Friend Functions
We'll take a look at a special category of functions called friends.

The private data members of a class are only accessible through the functions present 
in that class. Nothing from outside can manipulate the class object without using its 
functions.

What if we need to access class variables in a function which is not a part of the class? 
That function would have to become a friend of the class.

A friend function is an independent function which has access to the variables and 
methods of its befriended class.

To create a friend function for a class, it must be declared in the class along with 
the friend keyword.

Letâ€™s create a Ball class to explain this better:

In line 25, we can see that the Ball object is being passed by reference to the friend 
function. This is a crucial step in the functionality of the friend. If the object is 
not passed by reference, the changes made in the friend function will not work outside 
its scope. Basically, our object will not be altered.

The setRadius() function is completely independent of the Ball class, yet it has access 
to all the private variables. This is the beauty of the friend keyword.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Ball{
  double radius;
  string color;
  
  public:
  Ball(){
    radius = 0;
    color = "";
  }
  
  Ball(double r, string c){
    radius = r;
    color = c;
  }
  
  void printVolume();
  void printRadius();
  
  // The friend keyword specifies that this is a friend function
  friend void setRadius(Ball &b, double r); 
    
};

// This is a member function that calculates the volume.
void Ball::printVolume(){
  cout << (4/3) * 3.142 * radius * radius * radius << endl;
}

void Ball::printRadius(){
  cout << radius << endl;
}

// The implementation of our friend function
// Note that the "setRadius" below didn't have the class name associated to it,
// so it is accessing the variable of class "Ball" from outside the class
void setRadius(Ball &b, double r){
  b.radius = r;
}

 int main(){
   Ball b(30, "green");
   cout << "Radius: ";
   b.printRadius();
   setRadius(b, 60);
   cout << "New radius: ";
   b.printRadius();
   cout << "Volume: ";
   b.printVolume();
 }
